# Beta-cell-dysfunction in Type II Diabetes
Beta-cell-dysfunction data is obtained from NCBI 

Diffrential gene expession analysis and Path view analysis is performed (Using R script)

Gene expession data (read raw count) is normalize using TPM normalization (.Py script)

The normalized data is integrated into the HumanGEM model using INIT module in CobratoolBox (.Mat script)

The gene expression data integrated model is undergoes diffrent alalysis like Flux balance analysis, Flux sampling, Diffrential flux analysis (.Py script)
